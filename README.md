## Principle:

Using a tile URL to download map imagery is better because it gives you precision, consistency, and automation. Each tile URL includes zoom (z), x, and y coordinates, so you can request exact locations without manual effort. The images you download come in their original resolution, which is sharper and more accurate than screenshots.

Tile URLs can also be used in scripts, allowing automatic downloading of many tiles for stitching larger maps, offline use, or GIS projects. Because tile servers follow the standard XYZ Web Mercator format, the downloaded tiles match GIS coordinate systems, making them reliable for mapping or analysis.
